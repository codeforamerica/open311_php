		Response
		    services	root element 
		    service			Parent: services	 container for service_code, service_name, description, metadata, type, keywords, group 
		    service_code	Parent: service		The unique identifier for the service request type 
		    service_name	Parent: service		The human readable name of the service request type 
		    description		Parent: service		A brief description of the service request type. 
		    metadata		Parent: service		Possible values: true, false
		            				true: This service request type requires additional metadata so the client will need to make a call to the Service Definition method
		            				false: No additional information is required and a call to the Service Definition method is not needed. 
		    type			Parent: service		Possible values: realtime, batch, blackbox
		            				realtime: The service request ID will be returned immediately after the service request is submitted
		           					batch: A token will be returned immediately after the service request is submitted. This token can then be later used to return the service request ID.
		            				blackbox: No service request ID will be returned after the service request is submitted 
		   
		    keywords		Parent: service		A comma separated list of tags or keywords to help users identify the request type. This can provide synonyms of the service_name and group. 
		    group			Parent: service		A category to group this service type within. This provides a way to group several service request types under one category such as "sanitation"

	Required Arguments
	
	    jurisdiction_id
	    service_code (obtained from GET Service List method)
	    location: either lat & long or address_string or address_id must be submitted 
	
	Optional Arguments
	
	    lat				  latitude using the (WGS84) projection. 
	    long			  longitude using the (WGS84) projection. 
	    address_string	  Human entered address or description of location. This should be written from most specific to most general geographic unit, eg address number or cross streets, street name, neighborhood/district, city/town/village, county, postal code. This is required if no lat/lon is provided. 
	    address_id		  The internal address ID used by a jurisdictions master address repository or other addressing system. 
	    email			  The email address of the person submitting the request 
	    device_id		  The unique device ID of the device submitting the request. This is usually only used for mobile devices. For example, Android devices use TelephonyManager.getDeviceId() and iPhone's use [UIDevice currentDevice].uniqueIdentifier 
	    account_id		  The unique ID for the user account of the person submitting the request 
	    first_name		  The given name of the person submitting the request 
	    last_name		  The family name of the person submitting the request 
	    phone			  The phone number of the person submitting the request 
	    description		  A full description of the request or report being submitted. This may contain line breaks, but not html or code. Otherwise, this is free form text limited to 4,000 characters. 
	    media_url		  A URL to media associated with the request, eg an image. A convention for parsing media from this URL has yet to be established, so currently it will be done on a case by case basis. For example, if a jurisdiction accepts photos submitted via Twitpic.com, then clients can parse the page at the Twitpic URL for the image given the conventions of Twitpic.com. This could also be a URL to a media RSS feed where the clients can parse for media in a more structured way. 
	    attribute		  An array of key/value responses based on Service Definitions. This takes the form of attribute[code]=value where multiple code/value pairs can be specified as well as multiple values for the same code in the case of a multivaluelist datatype (attribute[code1][]=value1&attribute[code1][]=value2&attribute[code1][]=value3) - see example
